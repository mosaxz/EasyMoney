This project is just a simple way to work with money without 
needing to resolve floating-point errors and rounding. No one 
should expect a very complex project, or should use that without 
verify if has any potential errors. Multiply and Division in this 
project isn't reversible. That means that not always a equation
like "((x/y)*y) = x" is true.

This project use is intended as a easy way to calculate values 
and get averages and means without needing sharp precision and/or
getting always a two decimal place and having a easy monetary way 
to export a correct monetary string.

This is just a experiment and learning tool that will be used in a
demo project and has any free use and is made available as is without 
giving any liability to the authors.
